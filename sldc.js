// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirments = "This is the second step, it is the process of determining what is going to be required and expected before you start to code."
const design = "This is the third step, getting an idea of what the final prodcut is expected to look like and the features it will have."
const implementation = "This is the fourth step which involes writing the code based on the requirments for the project while following the design."
const testingAndImplementation = "This is the fifth step, in which you will test the code you wrote and make sure it runs correctly and meets all the requirements, also you will then implement your code with the rest of the code for the project and ultimetly finish the project."
const maintain = "This is the final step that is ongoing, forever fixing bugs and making sure that the software does what it is supposed to do and achieves the goal set out in your plan."
const rinseAndRepeat = "Repeat entire process for new features and updates."
